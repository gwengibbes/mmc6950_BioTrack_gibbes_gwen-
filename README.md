# BioTrack

BioTrack allows users to gather data by tracking bird sightings in documented locations.
A web application, called BioTrack, will be developed for this project. It will be an application that assists in gathering data by tracking animal sightings in documented locations. For this project, birds will be the first species that the web application will be developed for; however it is a transferable application that could be developed for any species of animal and documenting sightings in various areas. The application will employ a user-friendly format to receive and compile data on bird species. It will address the problem of how citizens can do their part in addressing the decreasing biodiversity across the world.
